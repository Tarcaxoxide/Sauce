.....
`1+2/3=a+5=b`

- 1+2 (3 is pushed into the stack)
- (3 is pulled from the stack) 3/3 (1 is pushed onto the stack)
- (1 is pulled from the stack) (1 is assigned to a variable named 'a') ('a' is pushed into the stack)
- ('a' is pulled from the stack) ('a' is looked up in the variable table resulting in 1) 1+5 (6 is pushed onto the stack)
- (6 is pulled from the stack) (6 is assigned to a variable named 'b')
